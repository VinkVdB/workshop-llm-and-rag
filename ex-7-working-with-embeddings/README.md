# Module 7: Working with Text Embeddings

## Objective
Learn about text embeddings and how to use them for similarity searches.

## Contents
- Explanation of embeddings and vector spaces.
- Performing arithmetic with embeddings (e.g., king - queen + woman = man).
- Integrating vector databases into Spring Boot applications.

## Exercises
1. **Embedding Arithmetic:**
   - Use embeddings to perform analogy tasks.
   - Visualize embeddings in a vector space.
2. **Vector Similarity Search:**
   - Index documents using embeddings.
   - Retrieve relevant documents based on query similarity.
3. **Data Chunking:**
   - Implement chunking of large texts.
   - Store and retrieve chunks using embeddings.
4. **Manual Vector Retrieval:**
   - Manually fetch vectors to understand relevance scoring.
   - Observe issues with irrelevant data retrieval.
