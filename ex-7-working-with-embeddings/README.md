# Module 7: Working with Text Embeddings

## Objective
Learn about text embeddings and how to use them for similarity searches.

## Contents
- Explanation of embeddings and vector spaces.
- Performing arithmetic with embeddings (e.g., king - queen + woman = man).

## Exercises
1. **Embedding Arithmetic:**
   - Use embeddings to perform analogy tasks.
   - Visualize embeddings in a vector space.
2. **Manual Vector Retrieval:**
   - Manually fetch vectors to understand relevance scoring.
   - Observe issues with irrelevant data retrieval.
