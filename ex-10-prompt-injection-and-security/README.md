# Module 10: Prompt Injection and Security

## Objective
Understand the risks of prompt injection and how to mitigate them.

## Contents
- Explanation of prompt injection attacks.
- Best practices for securing LLM applications.
- Testing prompts for vulnerabilities.

## Exercises
1. **Prompt Injection Simulation:**
   - Craft inputs that could lead to prompt injection.
   - Observe how the LLM responds and identify weaknesses.
2. **Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Implement input validation and sanitization.
   - Use guardrails or prompt templates to enforce boundaries.
3. **Prompt Testing:**
   - Develop tests to ensure prompts are secure.
   - Automate prompt testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
