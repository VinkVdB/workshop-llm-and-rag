# Module 5: Context Enrichment with Text Files

## Objective
We need to enrich the prompt by adding state, such as the current date and user name.
Understand context enrichment by reading and incorporating text file contents into prompts.

## Contents
- Reading files in Spring Boot applications.
- Enriching prompts with external data.
- Managing context size limitations.

## Exercises
1. Enrich prompts with the **current date** and **user name**.
2. Information Retrieval:
   - Enrich the prompt with contents from a single file.
   - Limit context size to 500 characters and observe the impact. This is to mimic the real-world scenario where the context size is limited.
